<h2> Yum! Now it's time to pick out an outfit. Carlos takes his looks very seriously, so you better pick a good one. His entire repuation may rest upon wearing the right outfit today. 
One time last year, he wore socks with sandals. He looked so unbelievably cool, that people refused to speak to him out of pure jealousy. We cannot have another situation like this
happen again. </h2>
