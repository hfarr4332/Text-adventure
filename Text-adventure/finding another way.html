    <p>Steve notices that the ground under the plant is starting to crack. He yells at everyone to find a way to break the ground. "Couldn't we keep shooting at it so it gets heavier?" someone asks.</p>
    <p>"Fire as much as you can and run!" the captain orders. Immediately, everyone starts firing as fast as they can. As they back away, the plant starts to grow bigger than the tallest tree Steve had ever seen. Steve hears a scream as he looks back and sees one of his crewmates being grabbed by a long tendril. He fires a few more quick shots at the plant, but none of them are able to free the crew member. At this point, the plant is getting huge and the ground is looking more and more unstable. </p>
