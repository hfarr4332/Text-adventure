    <p>Steve aims his blaster and takes 2 quick shots at the plant's flower. They don't seem to do much of anything. Steve then takes a few shots at the tendril that is holding the captain. Only one of them is on target, but it is enough to break the plant's grasp and send the captain falling to the ground. The other two shots hit the plant's body and leave dark burn marks where they land.</p>
