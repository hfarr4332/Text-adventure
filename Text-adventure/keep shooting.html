    <p>Steve hears a voice yell "SHOOT" followed by a flurry of blaster shots flying towards the plant. Steve starts blasting away at the plant again, too. After a few seconds, the crew's blasters all seem to be silent. When Steve looks up, he sees that the plant has grown taller than it already was. Steve backs up a few feet and jumps out of the way as a huge leaf swipes at him.</p>
