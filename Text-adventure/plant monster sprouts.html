    <p>Steve walks out of the ship and follows everyone else. After an hour or so, they come across some small plant sprouts coming from the ground. The captain squats down to collect one, and the ground starts to shake. The sprout he is trying to collect suddenly grows to become taller a tree, and it has a large, closed purple flower at the top. The flower then opens and the thing unleashes a terrible roar. It reaches out with a leafy tendril to grab the captain, who was still staring up in awe.</p>
