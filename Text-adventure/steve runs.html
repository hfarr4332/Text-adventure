    <p>Without a second thought, Steve turns and runs as fast as his legs can carry him. Even though he isn't sure he's heading towards the ships, he continues in the direction he's going. Eventually he does find the ships, and flies one back towards the base. Immediately when he gets there, he is greeted by a group of soldiers ready to arrest him. They throw him in a cell and tell him that he'll get a trial when they land back on Earth.</p>
