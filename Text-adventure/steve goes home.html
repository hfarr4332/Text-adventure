    <p>Steve decides to keep shooting at the plant because he doesn't know what else to do. The plant looks straight at him and takes a big swipe at him with a huge leaf. It hits Steve and he can feel his body fly back before he hits the ice and everything goes dark.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>Steve wakes up in a hospital bed. He has a pounding headache, and his whole body is sore. He stands up and walks to find the captain after chugging the glass of water by his head. He leaves his room and sees that he is at the end of the hall. When he makes it to the hospital lobby, he finds the captain about to come inside. The captain spots Steve and runs up to him.</p>
    <p>"Steve! I didn't know if you were gonna make it!" he says. "You were out cold long enough that we were able to have you transferred to a hospital here on Earth."</p>
    <p>"Wow," Steve says, "I didn't know we were on Earth. Does that mean I can go home?"</p>
    <p>"Sure, after you put some real clothes on," the captain replies. Steve glances down at his hospital gown.</p>
    <br><br> 
    <p>Steve goes home and lives the rest of his days as a regular family man.</p>
