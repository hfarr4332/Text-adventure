    <p>Steve follows the group to the loading bay, where three large ships are waiting. The captain yells out assignments for each ship and eventually calls out Steve's number for the third ship. Steve boards it and sits down in the front. All the buttons and levers intimidate him, but another man sits down in the chair next to him and says that he'll do most of the technical stuff. He introduces himself as Lou. Steve introduces himself, too. Not long after, they take off towards the planet.</p>
