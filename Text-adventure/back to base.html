    <p>Steve follows the group as they make their way back to where they left the ships. While they're walking, the captain comes up to him and says "Nice work, Steve. Your quick thinking is why I'm walking right now instead of being carried."</p>
    <p>"Thanks, captain," Steve says, "It means a lot."</p>
    <br>
    <p>When they get back to the ships, everyone climbs into the one they landed on as one crew member sets something on fire on the ground, then runs back into his ship. As he's taking off, he hears a whistling and gets worried that something is wrong with the ship, so he looks back. When he looks through the back window, he sees a brilliant show of fireworks spreading throughout the dark blue skies. When the fireworks finally look small, like ripples in a lake, Steve is finally able to focus on flying. </p>

    <p>When they get to the base, a man is standing by the door with a clipboard in his hands. As everyone gets out of their ships, he gestures to them to gather around him. "Alright everyone, these are all the people who have completed their service and can go home," he says. Steve doesn't really listen, because he only got to the base a few days ago. The man finishes his list without calling Steve's name or number. As the men all leave the hangar, the captain pulls Steve aside and asks if he would like to go home or get a promotion.</p>
