<h2> Carlos called his good friend Donkey, and he came over without hesitation. Upon opening the door for him, Donkey sprung up into Carlos's arms and began
to hug him. This hug went on for quite some time, and eventually Carlos was struggling for air. Donkey's grip was tight as can be, and Carlos was, well, as fragile as a stick. 
Donkey's overbearing love and affection proceeded to overwhelm Carlos. Until eventually, he was loosing too much air. Donkey, unaware of what he was doing,
watched as Carlos fell limp and dropped to the floor. He killed Carlos.  </h2>
